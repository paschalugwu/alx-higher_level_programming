# Project Title: Alx Higher Level Programming - Python Everything is Object

## Overview
This project is part of the Alx Higher Level Programming curriculum, focusing on Python and the concept that "Everything is an Object" in Python. The project consists of a series of tasks, each contained in a separate file within the `0x09-python-everything_is_object` directory of the GitHub repository `alx-higher_level_programming`. Each file corresponds to a specific task and contains answers to questions related to Python object behavior.
