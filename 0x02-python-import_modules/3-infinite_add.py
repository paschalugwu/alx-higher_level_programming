Check if the script is being executed directly by adding the following code:
"""
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Import the  sys  module to work with command-line arguments:
    import sys
    # Initialize a variable  total  to store the sum of the arguments:

    number of arguments:

    """
    Use a loop to iterate over the command-line arguments and
    add them to the  total variable. Start the loop from index
    1 to exclude the script name itself:

    for i in range(1, length):
        total += int(sys.argv[i])

    Print the  total  value followed by a new
    line using string formatting:
