# ALX Higher Level Programming - Almost a Circle

This repository contains a series of Python classes that form the basis for managing geometric shapes, specifically rectangles and squares. Each class is designed to inherit from a base class that provides shared functionality and attributes.

## 1. Base Class

### `models/base.py`

The `Base` class is the foundation for managing the identification of geometric shapes. It includes methods for converting instances to JSON strings, creating instances from dictionaries, and loading instances from files.

#### Methods:

- `def to_json_string(list_dictionaries):`
  - Converts a list of dictionaries to a JSON string representation.

- `def from_json_string(json_string):`
  - Converts a JSON string to a list of dictionaries.

- `def create(**dictionary):`
  - Creates an instance with attributes set using the provided dictionary.

- `def load_from_file():`
  - Loads instances from a file and returns a list of instances.

- `def save_to_file_csv(list_objs):`
  - Serializes instances to CSV format and saves them to a file.

- `def load_from_file_csv():`
  - Deserializes instances from a CSV file and returns a list of instances.

## 2. Rectangle Class

### `models/rectangle.py`

The `Rectangle` class inherits from the `Base` class and represents rectangles. It includes methods for calculating area, displaying the rectangle, and updating its attributes.

#### Methods:

- `def __init__(self, width, height, x=0, y=0, id=None):`
  - Initializes a new instance of the `Rectangle` class.

- `def area(self):`
  - Calculates and returns the area of the rectangle.

- `def display(self):`
  - Displays the rectangle using the '#' character.

- `def update(self, *args, **kwargs):`
  - Updates the attributes of the rectangle.

- `def to_dictionary(self):`
  - Converts the rectangle instance to a dictionary representation.

## 3. Square Class

### `models/square.py`

The `Square` class inherits from the `Rectangle` class and represents squares. It includes methods for updating its attributes and converting the instance to a dictionary.

#### Methods:

- `def __init__(self, size, x=0, y=0, id=None):`
  - Initializes a new instance of the `Square` class.

- `def update(self, *args, **kwargs):`
  - Updates the attributes of the square.

- `def to_dictionary(self):`
  - Converts the square instance to a dictionary representation.

## 4. Testing

### Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```

Ensure that all files, classes, and methods are unit tested, and PEP 8 validation is applied.

## 5. Utilities

### Save and Load Examples

#### Save to File

```python
r1 = Rectangle(10, 7, 2, 8)
r2 = Rectangle(2, 4)
list_rectangles_input = [r1, r2]

Rectangle.save_to_file(list_rectangles_input)
```

#### Load from File

```python
list_rectangles_output = Rectangle.load_from_file()
```

#### Save to CSV File

```python
Rectangle.save_to_file_csv(list_rectangles_input)
```

#### Load from CSV File

```python
list_rectangles_output = Rectangle.load_from_file_csv()
```

Feel free to explore and utilize the provided classes for your geometric shape management needs!
