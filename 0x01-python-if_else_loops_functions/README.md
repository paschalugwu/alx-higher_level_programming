# Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Description
This project consists of several Python scripts that demonstrate various concepts related to if-else statements, loops, and functions. Each script solves a specific problem or demonstrates a specific concept.

## Tasks
1. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
2. The last digit
3. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
5. Hexadecimal printing
6. 00...99
7. islower
8. To uppercase
9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
10. a + b
11. a ^ b
12. Fizz Buzz
13. Insert in sorted linked list
14. Smile in the mirror
15. Remove at position
16. ByteCode -> Python #2

## How to Use
Each script can be executed independently. Simply run the script using the Python interpreter and observe the output.
