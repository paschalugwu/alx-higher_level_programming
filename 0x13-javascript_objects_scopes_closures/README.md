# JavaScript - Objects, Scopes, and Closures

This repository contains a series of projects focused on JavaScript fundamentals, specifically on objects, scopes, and closures. These projects are designed to help you grasp essential concepts in JavaScript programming and improve your understanding of object-oriented programming principles.

## Author

**Paschal Ugwu**

## Learning Objectives

By completing these projects, you will be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to create an object in JavaScript
- Understanding of `this` keyword
- Interpretation of `undefined`
- Importance of variable type and scope
- Understanding closures and prototypes
- Inheriting an object from another

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpretation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x)
- Files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/node`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should be semistandard compliant with semicolons on top (reference: AirBnB style)
- All files must be executable

## Installation and Setup

To install Node.js version 14, run the following commands:

```bash
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

To install the semistandard documentation, use:

```bash
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
```

## Tasks

1. **Rectangle #0**
    - Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.

2. **Rectangle #1**
    - Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with width and height attributes.

3. **Rectangle #2**
    - Enhance Rectangle class to handle cases where width or height is 0 or not a positive integer.

4. **Rectangle #3**
    - Add an instance method `print()` to Rectangle class to print the rectangle using the character 'X'.

5. **Rectangle #4**
    - Add instance methods `rotate()` and `double()` to Rectangle class.

6. **Square #0**
    - Create a Square class that inherits from Rectangle.

7. **Square #1**
    - Enhance Square class with an instance method `charPrint(c)`.

8. **Occurrences**
    - Write a function to return the number of occurrences in a list.

9. **Esrever**
    - Write a function to return the reversed version of a list without using the built-in method `reverse`.

10. **Log me**
    - Write a function to print the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.

11. **Number conversion**
    - Write a function to convert a number from base 10 to another base passed as an argument.

12. **Factor index** (Advanced)
    - Import an array and compute a new array by multiplying each value with its index.

13. **Sorted occurrences** (Advanced)
    - Import a dictionary of occurrences by user id and compute a dictionary of user ids by occurrence.

14. **Concat files** (Advanced)
    - Write a script to concatenate two files.
